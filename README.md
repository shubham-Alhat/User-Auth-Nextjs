# Next JS

### WE will build auth-system

## Theory of Next js.

**Just talk about project structure, that src is main folder where app folder is there. in app, there is frontend and backend. go to docs and read.**

### How I set up project.

1. Make sure **folder name** you open in vs code should be in **lowercase**.
2. Run the following command with at last `.` . **It means create project in current directory.**

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest .
```
